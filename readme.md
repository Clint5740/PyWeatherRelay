This is a announcer/TTS announcer program for emergency alerts. Still going through troubleshooting.
Requires Python 3.9

Will eventually be compatible with .exe's through tkinter.

# **HOW TO SET UP**
Execute these commands in Python IDLE to install the modules:

pip install gtts

pip install playsound

pip install PyObjC

pip install nwsapy

Email can be changed in the API. I cannot access this, this is a NWS requirement for access.
