# ***HOW TO SET UP***
# Execute these commands to install the modules:

# pip install gtts
# pip install playsound
# pip install PyObjC
# pip install nwsapy


# ***Mac / Linux Exclusive***
# If you are not a Mac/Linux user, skip this segment.
# *Linux / Mac users will be required to install Brew + Shapely.*

# To do so, paste this in your terminal:

# /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# DO NOT CLICK THE LINK. Not sure why, it's just suggested otherwise.
# Requires ~9gb of space for xCode.

# You will be required to set a name and email in the program. 
# It is exclusively to access the API, nothing else.
# More info if needed is in main.py. Good luck!
